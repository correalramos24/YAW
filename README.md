## Introduction
YAW parses recipe files (in YAML format) and executes each step described in the recipe. Each step contains several parameters that tune the execution of the step.

![YAW](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97c26c4e-9ba8-40cf-9f20-03c87646e4de)

The most powerful capability of this tool is the ability to generate recipe variations; if the recipe contains a multivalue parameter (list)
YAW automatically generates all the combinations (cartesian mode) or joins by order of the different values(zip mode). This allows systematical executions
with only writing a YAML file. There are several "runners" available and you can extend the runnerns for a custom use case.

## Installation
Clone the repository with `--recursive` or initialize the submodules.
````bash
git clone git@github.com:correalramos24/YAW.git --recursive
# OR
git clone git@github.com:correalramos24/YAW.git
cd YAW
git submodule init
git submodule update
````
Add the `bin` folder to the path of your system and call `yaw` to execute the application.

## Usage
1. Generate recipe template: Use `--generate <recipie type>` to generate an empty template.
2. Fill the YAML file with your values for the required parameters.
3. Executing the recipie with `yaw <recipe file(s)> --parse` will explain what is going to be executed
4. Run recipies: Use `yaw <recipe file(s)>` to run the recipies. YAW will first parse the recipes and then run them sequentially.
5. Check the results: Check the output from the command line to see the execution results.

## Creating your runner - Runner hierarchy
YAW was defined using a object-oriented hierarchy to be easy to extend:

| TODO: Add UML here!

### AbstractRunner - Minimal parameters

The abstract runner defines the minimal parameters to execute something. It manages:

* type: Set the runner type
* mode: Set the mode for multirecipie parameters. `zip` by default
* log_file: Dump the execution to a log file
* env_file: Set the environment file.
* track_env: Dump the environment to a file. `env.log` by default
* rundir: Set the rundir to execute the runner. If not set, it will be set to the current path where YAW was invoked.
* create_dir: Create the rundir. 
* overwrite: Overwrite the rundir
* dry: Not execute anything, just set the rundir. `false` by default
* mirror: Generate mirror runners.

It also defines the two execution steps, a first one where the parameters are managed and a second one where the execution happens.

### SlurmAbstractRunner - SLURM parameters

Define an interface to interact with SLURM jobs. 
### AbstractFilesRunner

### BashRunner

Extends the abstract runner to execute commands using bash and inflate the rundir.
It uses the AbstractFilesRunner functionalities.
* bash_cmd: Bash command to be executed.
* args: Arguments of the `bash_cmd`.
* wrapper: wrapper of the bash_cmd (`time` for example).
* script_name: name of the script to encapsulate the commands. `yaw_wrapper.sh` by default.

### Using pytests

There is support of use unittest. To use them you need to:

````bash
# Go to yaw folder
source tests/test_env.sh
python3 tests/test_your_test_name.py
````
