YAW automatically generates all the combinations (cartesian mode) or joins by order the different values(zip mode)

2. Run recipies: Use `yaw <recipe file(s)>` to run the recipies


## Example
TBD


## Extending the functionalities

YAW is designed following a modular design, despite is hardly recommended to 
tune your functionalities using your bash scripts you can also extend YAW
core to add **new types of recipie runners**.
